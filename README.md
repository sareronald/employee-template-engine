Unit 10 OOP Homework: Template Engine - Employee Summary

This app is a Node CLI that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Since testing is a key piece in making code maintainable, you will also be ensuring that all unit tests pass. 

## Project Objective
The application will prompt the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. The user can imput any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user. 
The application will be invoked with the following command:

```
node app.js
```

To perform tests, run the following command:

```
npm test
```
